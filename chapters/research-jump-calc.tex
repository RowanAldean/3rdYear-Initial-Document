\section{Existing vertical jump calculators}
There are few \textit{modern} jump calculators on the market right now. None are combined with existing fitness platforms -
our research shows all of them being standalone mobile or web applications (\labelcref{research:fitness-meter,research:whats-my-vert,research:my-jump}).
\par
There are multiple methods of measuring jump height, often this is important to athletes 
where success is caused/correlated with jump ability i.e. Sprinting \cite{jump-sprint-link}, American football, Basketball, Volleyball.
We also know vertical jump is an important test to assess the explosive strength of the leg
musculature of athletes \cite{aspects-of-strength,nsa-strength-in-athletes}.
We'll be using the time-in-air (TIA) to estimate jump height. Whilst this is inevitably not perfectly
accurate, when using a force plate \footnote{A measuring instrument that measures the ground reaction forces generated by somebody.}
it is no worse than other methods (in terms of consistency) \cite{measuring-jump-paper}.
Thereby still proving useful to the target demographic.
\par
To summarise, the vertical jump calculator created for the project is intended for use as a measurement of progress
and not a concrete result. There will be some deviation from other measurements (such as using a \href{https://www.topendsports.com/testing/products/vertical-jump/vertec.htm}{Vertec}).

\subsection{Maths behind calculating vertical jump using video}
\label{research:jump-maths}
Below we'll be considering the mathematics involved in finding vertical jump height using
\textbf{only smartphone video footage}.
\par
To explain the forces demonstrated in a countermovement jump (CMJ)\footnote{A vertical jump test performed by having an athlete quickly squat to a self-selected depth and then jump as high as possible.}
we'll be considering the 5 phases of action involved (\cref{fig:jump-phases}).
\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{jump-maths/phases-of-cmj.png}
	\caption{The sequence of actions involved in a CMJ.}

	\input{graphics/jump-maths/force-plate-graph.tex}
	\caption{Ground reaction forces during vertical jump.}
	\label{fig:jump-phases-graph}
\end{figure}
\par
We'll use a simplified example of a force plate analysis (\todo[color=purple]{reference graph}). In reality the force curve won't be so smooth
but this should demonstrate the phases quite clearly. 



\[\displaystyle F = m * g\]
\[
	\displaystyle
	\begin{aligned}
	981 N &= m * 9.81 m/s^2 \\ \\
	=> m &= \frac{981N}{9.81 m/s^2} = 100kg
	\end{aligned}	
\]

$$F_{Jumper} = F_{GRF} - F_{Gravity} <=0$$

\[F = m a => F t = m a t
\]
Because F is not constant but a function of time, and $v =a t$:
\par
$$\displaystyle
=> \int_{t_1}^{t_2} F_{Jumper}(t) \mathrm{d}t = m v$$

\[\displaystyle
\begin{aligned}
\int_{t_1}^{t_2} F(t) \mathrm{d}t = m v\\ \\
=> -70 N s = 100kg * v\\
=> v = -70 N s / 100kg = -0.7 m/s
\end{aligned}
\]
