\section{Existing vertical jump calculators}
There are few \textit{modern} jump calculators on the market right now. None are combined with existing fitness platforms -
our research shows all of them being standalone mobile or web applications (\labelcref{research:fitness-meter,research:whats-my-vert,research:my-jump}).
\par
There are multiple methods of measuring jump height, often this is important to athletes 
where success is caused/correlated with jump ability i.e. Sprinting \cite{jump-sprint-link}, American football, Basketball, Volleyball.
We also know vertical jump is an important test to assess the explosive strength of the leg
musculature of athletes \cite{aspects-of-strength,nsa-strength-in-athletes}.
We'll be using the time-in-air (TIA) to estimate jump height. Whilst this is inevitably not perfectly
accurate, when using a force plate \footnote{A measuring instrument that measures the ground reaction forces generated by somebody.}
it is no worse than other methods (in terms of consistency) \cite{measuring-jump-paper}.
Thereby still proving useful to the target demographic.
\par
To summarise, the vertical jump calculator created for the project is intended for use as a measurement of progress
and not a concrete result. There will be some deviation from other measurements (such as using a \href{https://www.topendsports.com/testing/products/vertical-jump/vertec.htm}{Vertec}).

\textbf{only smartphone video footage}.
