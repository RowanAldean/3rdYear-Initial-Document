\section{Existing vertical jump calculators}
There are few \textit{modern} jump calculators on the market right now. None are combined with existing fitness platforms -
our research shows all of them being standalone mobile or web applications (\labelcref{research:fitness-meter,research:whats-my-vert,research:my-jump}).
\par
There are multiple methods of measuring jump height, often this is important to athletes 
where success is caused/correlated with jump ability i.e. Sprinting \cite{jump-sprint-link}, American football, Basketball, Volleyball.
We also know vertical jump is an important test to assess the explosive strength of the leg
musculature of athletes \cite{aspects-of-strength,nsa-strength-in-athletes}.
We'll be using the time-in-air (TIA) to estimate jump height. Whilst this is inevitably not perfectly
accurate, when using a force plate \footnote{A measuring instrument that measures the ground reaction forces generated by somebody.}
it is no worse than other methods (in terms of consistency) \cite{measuring-jump-paper}.
Thereby still proving useful to the target demographic.
\par
To summarise, the vertical jump calculator created for the project is intended for use as a measurement of progress
and not a concrete result. There will be some deviation from other measurements (such as using a \href{https://www.topendsports.com/testing/products/vertical-jump/vertec.htm}{Vertec}).

\subsection{Maths behind calculating vertical jump using video}
\label{research:jump-maths}
Below we'll be considering the physics \cite{hoopsgeek-maths} involved in finding vertical jump height using
\textbf{only smartphone video footage}.
\par
To explain the forces demonstrated in a countermovement jump (CMJ)\footnote{A vertical jump test performed by having an athlete quickly squat to a self-selected depth and then jump as high as possible.}
we'll be considering the 5 phases of action involved (\cref{fig:jump-phases}).
\begin{figure}[H]

	\label{fig:jump-phases-graph}
\end{figure}
\pagebreak

We'll be using the above, simplified force plate analysis (\cref{fig:jump-phases-graph}),
to delve further into the phases of a jump and the mathematics. 
In reality the force curve wouldn't be so smooth
but this should demonstrate the phases quite clearly.
\par
\textbf{Phase 1: Rest (Pre-jump)}
\par
Before jumping we can see a flat line at $981$ Newton (\cref{fig:jump-phases-graph}). The athlete isn't jumping, but this is gravity doing it's
work. It's easily explained as $F=m*g$, where $m$ is the mass of the athlete and
$g$ is the acceleration of earth's gravity. $F$ is the force needed to counter the effects of gravity. We know that $g=9.81m/s^2$ on earth, thus:
\[
	\displaystyle
	\begin{aligned}
	981N &= m * 9.81 m/s^2 \\
	=> m &= \frac{981N}{9.81 m/s^2} = 100kg
	\end{aligned}	
\]
Here you can see that the force plate is basically acting as a weighing scale, showing
the force gravity exerts on the athlete.
\par
\textbf{Phase 2: Countermovement}
\par
As seen in \cref{fig:jump-phases}, the countermovement involves
the bending of the knees and typically swinging of the arms to lower the center
of gravity before the jump. The force plate (\cref{fig:jump-phases-graph}) is 
registering forces lower than 981N, which means the athlete is accelerating
in a downward movement.
\par
Recall Newton's 3rd Law of motion; 
which states whenever two objects interact, they exert equal and opposite forces on each other.
Knowing the above, we can define Ground Reaction Force (GRF) as ``the force exerted by the ground
on a body in contact with it''. 
We can describe the forces acting at this time as follows:
$$F_{Jumper} = F_{GRF} - F_{Gravity} <=0$$
We can also use the analysis (\cref{fig:jump-phases-graph}) to find
the speed the athlete is moving at before the jump. We know that
$F=ma$ (mass * acceleration), and force is happening over time.
Thus, $Ft=mat$.  
We also know force isn't a constant, it's a function of time and that we can define velocity as $v=at$;
so our formula is:
$$\displaystyle
\int_{t_1}^{t_2} F_{Jumper}(t) \mathrm{d}t = mv$$
where $F_{Jumper}(t)$ is the difference between the GRF and gravity.
\pagebreak
The integral can be calculated from the force plate data. The downward impulse\footnote{Impulse is the integral of a force.} made by
the athlete is shown in the graph (\cref{fig:jump-phases-graph}) as the blue area
below the line representing gravity.
\par
We've assumed the integral (impulse) is -70Ns\footnote{Newton seconds are the units of impulse.}. 
With this, we can conclude that:
\begin{align*}
& \int_{t_1}^{t_2} F(t) \mathrm{d}t = m v \\
&=> -70 N s = 100kg * v \\
&=> v = -70 N s / 100kg = -0.7 m/s
\end{align*}
Therefore, our athlete reaches a peak velocity of -0.7m/s during the countermovement phase.
