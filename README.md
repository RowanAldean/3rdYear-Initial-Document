# Initial Document: A Multifunctional Fitness Application \& Vertical Jump Height Calculator

This repository contains all the source files for the compilation of my Initial Document for my Final Year Project at Swansea University (Class of 2022).

Extensive alterations have been made to the template provided by the University and further forks and changes are encouraged. It should be noted that best practices were not always followed (especially with example graphs that are intended to be less precise).

You can [read/download the full document via thesis.pdf](https://github.com/RowanAldean/3rdYear-Initial-Document/blob/master/thesis.pdf).

It must be noted that I was heavily penalised for the document length (for future students... treat the soft cap as a hard cap), despite it being comprehensive.
